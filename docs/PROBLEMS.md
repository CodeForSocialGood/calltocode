## <a name="database"></a> Database Troubleshooting

The MongoDB is ran in a docker container. You will need to have ports 27017 and 28017 open. After the database is created, seed data is automatically imported so that testing can be done.

1. Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) is installed:
    ```bash
    $ docker --version
    ```
1. Have direnv set up properly with `direnv allow`. See the [Development Environment Setup](DEVELOPER.md) if you have not done so already. At the very least, run `source .env`.
1. Start and seed the MongoDB database:
    ```bash
    $ yarn db
    ```
1. Make sure the database is running by running yarn start:dev (should see 'Database Connected')
1. Make sure database is seeded by either checking the data in Robo 3T if you downloaded that (see [Development Environment Setup](DEVELOPER.md)) or by trying to log in with Kevin's credentials (check them in the `Personas` story in the Icebox on Pivotal Tracker)
